Hi, I'm Brandon.

I got into programming later than most people. Two years into studying music at UC Berkeley, I
wanted to take a class on computer music. Unfortunately, one of the requirements for the class was a
semester of computer science. So, never having coded anything in my life, I resolved to try to meet
the requirement and scrape my way through cs101.

Within a month, I was hooked.

I ended up switching my major and graduating with a degree in computer science. I thought after
graduating from one of the top schools it'd be easy to land a job as a developer.

But it wasn't.

When it came time to get my first internship, I only managed to get one offer. And just barely. The
first day on the job I wasn't even able to complete the welcome tasks. I thought there was something
wrong with me.

Seeing me frustrated, a full-time engineer on the team took me under his wing. He told me a hard
truth:

> “The computer science field changes so fast, there is no way to possibly learn everything you need
> to know from a traditional education or on your own. You need to learn on the job or from other
> engineers.”

Over the next few weeks, he sent me material on things I had missed the past four years. As I
started writing code, he gave me feedback on what I was writing and how to improve it. Slowly but
surely I started to learn, and eventually ended up getting a full-time offer from the company that
launched my career.

I want to do the same for you.

I'm passionate about the art of writing beautiful yet practical code, and I'm passionate about
teaching it. I want to help others fall in love with programming just like I did.
