### Are you trying to land a job as a web developer? Or level up your coding skills to rapidly advance your career?

<h2 style="text-align: center">Read on.</h2>

After working for years at both elite Silicon Valley corporations and disruptive startups as a web
developer, I realized there's a fundamental flaw in the talent pipeline.

Something that makes it difficult to get your foot in the door, but that **you** can take advantage
of to put yourself far above other candidates when interviewing and securing those first crucial
promotions.

What is it?

> **There is no clear, definable curriculum that describes what you need to know to be an
> exceptional web developer.**

Let me explain...

I got into programming later than most people. Two years into studying music at UC Berkeley, I
wanted to take a class on computer music. Unfortunately, one of the requirements for the class was a
semester of computer science. So, never having coded anything in my life, I resolved to try to meet
the requirement and scrape my way through cs101.

Within a month, I was hooked.

I ended up switching my major and graduating with a degree in computer science. I thought after
graduating from one of the top schools it'd be easy to land a job as a developer.

But it wasn't.

When it came time to get my first internship, I only managed to get one offer. And just barely. The
first day on the job I wasn't even able to complete the welcome tasks. I thought there was something
wrong with me.

Seeing me frustrated, a full-time engineer on the team took me under his wing. He told me a hard
truth:

> **The computer science field changes so fast, there is no way to possibly learn everything you
> need to know from a traditional education or on your own. You need to learn on the job or from
> other engineers.**

Over the next few weeks, he sent me material on things I had missed the past four years. As I
started writing code, he gave me feedback on what I was writing and how to improve it. Slowly but
surely I started to learn, and eventually ended up getting a full-time offer from the company that
launched my career.

<h2 style="text-align: center">I want to do the same for you</h2>

Fast forward to present day, I see this all the time in people trying to get into web development.

You may have taken an online course on Javascript, or a web design class in college. Or maybe you're
trying to learn React from YouTube videos and Medium articles. Things start off well. You're excited
about switching careers or building that app you've always dreamed of.

Then reality sets in. You get overwhelmed with the volume of, often conflicting, information that's
out there. You're unsure if what you're learning will get you a job. What does a web development
interview even look like?

Maybe you try building a website like the tutorial, but you don't know how to deploy it to a real
domain. Or something breaks and you get stuck debugging it.

Or you even get an intervew for a web developer role and they ask you about an algorithm you've
never heard of, so they tell you that you need more experience before they can consider hiring you.

You have no idea what to learn next or if it'll even be enough to get you hired. When will I know
enough, and how will I know when I'm there?

This is the fundamental flaw. But I want to help.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Private, one-on-one coaching</h2>

What if I told you that you could take advantage of this to massively accelerate your progress
towards achieving your dream career in software?

My private, one-on-one coaching sessions are a way for me to help you do that. During our first
meeting, I'll assess exactly where you are as a programmer and help you identify any gaps in
knowledge you may have. All absolutely free for the first session and at no risk to you.

Over the following few sessions, I will:

- Help you fill in any gaps in knowledge that may exist in the shortest time possible
- Create a personally tailored roadmap to get you from where you are now to where you want to be
- Teach you new programming concepts and explain them in a way that is easy to digest
- Coach you on writing code, both during live sessions together and in offline code review where I
  can dissect your code line by line and give you concrete feedback

With me as your coach, we'll learn the basics like HTML and CSS. We'll learn how to write modern
Javascript that employers are willing to pay an average of
[\$115,000 a year](https://www.indeed.com/career/javascript-developer/salaries) for, as well as
common tools like React, Redux, and Node.

We'll learn system design and architecture, letting you apply for one of the
[10,000 open software engineering roles in the United States](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=software+engineer+%22remote%22&l=United+States).
Many of them are remote, meaning you get the freedom to live and work from wherever you want.

We'll cover data structures and algorithms as well as general interviewing skills, giving you a huge
advantage over other self-taught programmers who may have not had a traditional computer science
education.

If you're already employed as a software engineer, I can help you as well. We'll work on soft skills
like driving technical decisions, project management, and effectively interacting with your peers
that managers look for when promoting developers to more senior roles.

Technically we'll continue to hone your code craftsmanship, getting practice designing large
distributed services and frontends that scale to serve millions of people.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Space is limited.</h2>

In addition to coaching, I continue to work as a full-time software engineer in Silicon Valley. As a
result, I only have space for the few clients a week that I can see outside of my regular work to
maintain the quality of my coaching.

If you're seeing this, it means I recently had a slot open up. In my experience, it will get filled
very quickly.

What are you waiting for?
